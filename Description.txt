[b]Compatible with 1.1.0[/b]

[h1]Key Features[/h1]

- Adds angle and distance measurements when building roads or train lines. 
- Hold CTRL to enable snapping to angles (in 5 degree increments) 
- Hold SHIFT to enable additional information display 
- Does not override the default NetTool, so should be compatible with most other mods. 


This is very much a beta release, I haven't done much testing yet. Let me know if you encounter any problems!
